# Nguyen_H_RokuApp

The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to access three separate flashback features; movies, television (tv) and music. Each of these three sections are comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 respectively.  

One of Flashback's main usability features is the demarcation of the user profile. Users will be divided into two distinct categories; administrators (labeled; Parents) and Kids. Parents will have the ability to access all of Flashbacks' content and admin controls while 'Kids' will be limited to content pushed down from Flashbacks “kid-friendly content" protocol queries. Admin users will have the ability to customize settings being pushed down from Flashbacks CMS to provide a unique viewing experience for their children. These features may include, but may not be exclusive to, such things as ratings, age appropriate etc.
